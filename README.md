# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn run hardhat help
yarn run hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true yarn run hardhat test
yarn run hardhat node
yarn run hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
